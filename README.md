## Data

### World Press Freedom Index
The Index **ranks 180 countries and regions according to the level of freedom available to journalists.** It is a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country and region.

### REIGN
Developed by Curtis Bell, the Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance (REIGN) dataset describes **political conditions in every country** each and every month. 

## Objectives

The objective of this **Data Analysis** notebook is to showcase varying degrees of **Freedom of the press** around the world depending on geographical location and political situation present in each country.

By utilising data provided by the **World Press Freedom Index** and **REIGN** datasets, my aim is to demonstrate which government forms are implemented in different countries in the world, which countries have the most and least free press and help understand a huge gap in **Freedom of the press** between democratic and non-democratic countries
